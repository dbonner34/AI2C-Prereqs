# 1. Create a class called CoffeeOrder

# 1.a: define the __init__ method with self, customer_name, and coffee_type parameters. 
#      set the self.is_completed to false

# 1.b: define describe with the self parameter
#      print the details of the order
#      Example: Order for Doug: One Hot Chocolate

# 1.c: define complete_order with the self parameter
#      this will mark the order as finished
#      self.is_completed = True
#      print the order is ready
#      Example: The Hot Chocolate for Doug is ready

# 2: testing the class
#    create two different coffee objects (Instances)
