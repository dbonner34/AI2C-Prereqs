# 1. Create a class called CoffeeOrder
class CoffeeOrder:
    
# 1.a: define the __init__ method with self, customer_name, and coffee_type parameters. 
#      set the self.is_completed to false    
    def __init__(self, customer_name, coffee_type):
        # Initializing the attributes
        self.customer_name = customer_name
        self.coffee_type = coffee_type
        self.is_completed = False  # Defaults to False as requested

# 1.b: define describe with the self parameter
#      print the details of the order (customer name and coffee type)
#      Example: Order for Doug: One Hot Chocolate
    def describe(self):
        """Prints the details of the order."""
        print(f"Order for {self.customer_name}: One {self.coffee_type}.")

# 1.c: define complete_order with the self parameter
#      this will mark the order as finished
#      self.is_completed = True
#      print the order is ready
#      Example: The Hot Chocolate for Doug is ready
    def complete_order(self):
        """Marks the order as finished."""
        self.is_completed = True
        print(f"✨ The {self.coffee_type} for {self.customer_name} is ready!")

# 2: testing the class
#    create two different coffee objects (Instances)
order1 = CoffeeOrder("Alice", "Latte")
order2 = CoffeeOrder("Bob", "Espresso")

# 3: describe the instances
order1.describe()
order2.describe()

# 4: complete one of the orders
#    print a header that reads "--- Update ---"
print("\n--- Update ---")
order1.complete_order()

# 5: check the status of both orders
print(f"Is Alice's order done? {order1.is_completed}")
print(f"Is Bob's order done? {order2.is_completed}")

# Expected Output:
# Order for Alice: One Latte.
# Order for Bob: One Espresso.

# --- Update ---
# ✨ The Latte for Alice is ready!
# Is Alice's order done? True
# Is Bob's order done? False
